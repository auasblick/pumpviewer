UJAMS Pumpviewer


General information:
The pumpviewer is designed to modify characteristic pump curves.It can
create new curves, and modify existing ones to find the most efficient pump
in its most efficient operating state for a certain use case.


Overview:
 - main
	central unification of the other modules
 - generationing
	module to generate pump curves from graphic information
	sheets
 - positioning
	module which is responsible for the graphic order of the
	window


UX:
 - main
	main panel (left):
		displays the characeristic pump curve(s), possibly modified
	tune panel (top right):
		enables adjustment of parameters defining the characeristic
		pump curve
	settings panel (bottom right):
		to be defined
 - generate
	collection panel (top left):
		pump collection settings
	file panel (bottom left):
		file location etc.
	drawing panel
		gives the possibility to trace the characteristic pump curve
		from an imported file
 - modify
